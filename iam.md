Users, groups, roles, permissions and policies.

These are crucial keywords when it comes to iam. 
- Users are simply users. 
- groups are groups of users with common permissions and common policies.
- permissions are essentially a set of policies for a user.
- roles are given to **aws resources** like ec2 instances for example for accessing other aws resources. For instance we can create a role for ec2 instances to have read and write accesses for s3 instances.
- policies are groups of access rules that a user can have.
